# 1) 
# Calculate the temporal and spatial variance (separately) 
# of each variable in the regional cube, using mapslices.

# 2) 
# Calculate the temporal variance for MSC and anomalies of air temperature.

# 3)
# Repeat 2, but use mapCube instead of mapslices


# 4) 
# Calculate a more robust correlation (see below) and 
# compare the difference to the regular correlation we computed.

# 5) 
# Calculate an "easy" ratio of NEE and GPP  (temporal) mean(NEE)/mean(GPP), for each pixel


# 6) 
# Extend 5 so that you return both ratio and temporal correlation 
# - how does outdims have to look now?
